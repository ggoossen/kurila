# NOTE!
#
# Think carefully before adding tests here.  In general this should be
# used only for about three categories of tests:
#
# (1) tests that absolutely require 'use utf8', and since that in general
#     shouldn't be needed as the utf8 is being obsoleted, this should
#     have rather few tests.  If you want to test Unicode and regexes,
#     you probably want to go to op/regexp or op/pat; if you want to test
#     split, go to op/split; pack, op/pack; appending or joining,
#     op/append or op/join, and so forth
#
# (2) tests that have to do with Unicode tokenizing (though it's likely
#     that all the other Unicode tests sprinkled around the t/**/*.t are
#     going to catch that)
#
# (3) complicated tests that simultaneously stress so many Unicode features
#     that deciding into which other test script the tests should go to
#     is hard -- maybe consider breaking up the complicated test
#
