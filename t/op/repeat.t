# This test is actually testing for Digital C compiler optimizer bug,
# present in Dec C versions 5.* and 6.0 (used in Digital UNIX and VMS),
# found in December 1998.  The bug was reported to Digital^WCompaq as
#     DECC 2745 (21-Dec-1998)
# GEM_BUGS 7619 (23-Dec-1998)
# As of April 1999 the bug has been fixed in Tru64 UNIX 5.0 and is planned
# to be fixed also in 4.0G.
#
# The bug was as follows: broken code was produced for util.c:repeatcpy()
# (a utility function for the 'x' operator) in the case *all* these
# four conditions held:
#
# (1) len == 1
# (2) "from" had the 8th bit on in its single character
# (3) count > 7 (the 'x' count > 16)
# (4) the highest optimization level was used in compilation
#     (which is the default when compiling Perl)
#
# The bug looked like this (. being the eight-bit character and ? being \xff):
#
# 16 ................
# 17 .........???????.
# 18 .........???????..
# 19 .........???????...
# 20 .........???????....
# 21 .........???????.....
# 22 .........???????......
# 23 .........???????.......
# 24 .........???????.???????
# 25 .........???????.???????.
#
# The bug was triggered in the "if (len == 1)" branch.  The fix
# was to introduce a new temporary variable.  In diff -u format:
#
#     register char *frombase = from;
#
#     if (len == 1) {
#-       todo = *from;
#+       register char c = *from;
#        while (count-- > 0)
#-           *to++ = todo;
#+           *to++ = c;
#        return;
#     }
#
# The bug could also be (obscurely) avoided by changing "from" to
# be an unsigned char pointer.
#
# This obscure bug was not found by the then test suite but instead
# by Mark.Martinec@nsc.ijs.si while trying to install Digest-MD5-2.00.
