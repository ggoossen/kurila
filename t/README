This is the perl test library.  To run most of the tests, just type './TEST'
(which will not run the tests residing in lib/ or ext/.  In order to run
all of the tests type 'make test' from the build direcotory above t/).

To add new tests, just look at the current tests and do likewise.

If a test fails, run it by itself to see if it prints any informative
diagnostics.  If not, modify the test to print informative diagnostics.
If you put out extra lines with a '#' character on the front, you don't
have to worry about removing the extra print statements later since TEST
ignores lines beginning with '#'.

If you know that Perl is basically working but expect that some tests
will fail, you may want to use Test::Harness thusly:
        cd t
	./perl -I../lib harness
This method pinpoints failed tests automatically.

If you come up with new tests, please send them to perlbug@perl.org.

Tests in the t/base/ directory ought to be runnable with plain miniperl.
That is, they should not require Config.pm nor should they require any
extensions to have been built.  TEST will abort if any tests in the
t/base/ directory fail.

Tests in the t/comp/, t/cmd/, t/run/, t/io/, and t/op/ directories should
also be runnable by miniperl and not require Config.pm, but failures
to comply will not cause TEST to abort like for t/base/.
