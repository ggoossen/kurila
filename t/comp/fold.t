# Historically constant folding was performed by evaluating the ops, and if
# they threw an exception compilation failed. This was seen as buggy, because
# even illegal constants in unreachable code would cause failure. So now
# illegal expressions are reported at runtime, if the expression is reached,
# making constant folding consistent with many other languages, and purely an
# optimisation rather than a behaviour change.
