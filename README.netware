=head1 Name

Perl for NetWare5.x

=head1 Description

This file gives the instructions for building Perl5.6 and above for
NetWare5.x.  Please read and understand the terms under which this
software is distributed.

=head1 Build

This section describes the steps to be performed to build a Perl NLM
and other associated NLMs.

=head2 Tools & SDK

The build requires Watcom 11.x compiler and linker.  In addition,
the "NetWare SDK", "NLM & NetWare Libraries for C" and
"NetWare Server Protocol Libraries for C", all available at
L<http://developer.novell.com/ndk/>, are also required.
Microsoft Visual C++ version 4.2 or later is also required.

Currently the interpreter builds only with Watcom and we do have plans of
making this work with CodeWarrior as well.

=head2 Setup

The build process is dependent on the location of the NetWare SDK.
Once the required software is installed, the build environment has to
be setup.  The following batch files setup the environment.

=over 4

=item Buildtype.bat

This sets the build type to release or debug.

=item SetNWBld.bat

This sets the NetWare SDK path, Compiler & other tools path & MPK SDK path.

=item MPKBuild.bat

This is required only it we are building multi-processor enabled NLMs.

These batch files are under NetWare\bat folder.  These batch files
call a couple of other batch files to setup the environment.  Invoking
the batch file with I</now> will show the current settings and I</h>
or I</?> gives the usage help.

=head2 Make

The make process runs only under WinNT shell.
The NetWare makefile is located under the NetWare folder.
The makefile for NetWare makes use of miniperl.exe to run some of
the Perl scripts.  To create miniperl.exe, run nmake from
win32 folder through WinNT command prompt.  The build process
can be stopped after miniperl.exe is created.  Then run nmake
from NetWare folder through WinNT command prompt.

Currently the following two build types are tested on NetWare

=over 4

=item *

USE_MULTI, USE_ITHREADS & USE_IMP_SYS defined

=item *

USE_MULTI & USE_IMP_SYS defined and USE_ITHREADS not defined

=back

=head2 Interpreter

Once miniperl.exe creation is over, run nmake from the NetWare folder.
This will build the Perl interpreter for NetWare as I<perl.nlm>.
This is copied under the I<Release> folder if you are doing
a release build, else will be copied under I<Debug> folder for debug builds.

=head2 Extensions

The make process also creates the Perl extensions which are called
NLPs (NetWare Loadable Perl).

=head1 Install

To install NetWare Perl onto a NetWare server, first map the Sys volume
of a NetWare server to I<i:>. This is because the makefile by default
sets the drive letter to I<i:>.  Type I<nmake nwinstall> from NetWare folder
on a WinNT command prompt.  This will copy the binaries and module files
onto the NetWare server.  The Perl interpreter, I<perl.nlm>, is copied under
I<sys:\perl\system> folder.  Copy I<perl.nlm> to I<sys:\system> folder.

=head1 Build new extensions

To build extensions other than standard extensions, NetWare Perl has
to be installed on Windows as well.  This can be done by invoking
I<nmake install> from the NetWare folder on a WinNT command prompt.
This will copy all the *.pm files and other required files.
Documentation files are not copied. This has to be done after
installing Perl for Windows. Once this is done, do the following
to build any extension:

=over 4

=item *

perl -II<path to NetWare lib dir> -II<path to lib> Makefile.pl

For example:

 perl -Ic:/perl/5.6.1/lib/NetWare-multi-thread -Ic:\perl\5.6.1\lib MakeFile.pl

=item *

nmake

=item *

nmake install

Install will copy the files into the Windows machine where NetWare
Perl is installed, these files have to be copied to the NetWare server
manually.  Alternatively, pass I<INSTALLSITELIB=i:\perl\lib> as an
input to makefile.pl above.  Where I<i:> is the mapped drive to the
sys: volume of the server where Perl on NetWare is installed.  Now
saying I<nmake install>, will copy the files to the server.

=head1 Known Issues

=over 4

=item * 

With USE_ITHREADS not defined, backtick seems to be having some problems.

=item *

The utility scripts (pod2html.pl, pod2man.pl, perldoc.pl etc.) are not
yet ported to work on NetWare.

=item *

Also fork() is not currently implemented.

=back

=head1 Acknowledgements

The makefile for Win32 is used as a reference to create the makefile
for NetWare build.  Also, the make process for NetWare port uses
miniperl.exe to run scripts during the make and installation process.
