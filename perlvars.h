/* This file describes the "global" variables used by perl
 * This used to be in perl.h directly but we want to abstract out into
 * distinct files which are per-thread, per-interpreter or really global,
 * and how they're initialized.
 *
 * The 'G' prefix is only needed for vars that need appropriate #defines
 * generated in embed*.h.  Such symbols are also used to generate
 * the appropriate export list for win32.
 *
 * Avoid build-specific #ifdefs here, like DEBUGGING.  That way,
 * we can keep binary compatibility of the curinterp structure */
