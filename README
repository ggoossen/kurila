ABOUT KURILA
============

Perl Kurila is a dialect of Perl. It can work besides Perl 5.

With Perl 5 as ancestor it has a solid base, but without the backwards
compatibility requirement of Perl 5, it is free to evolve into new
directions.

For a longer explanation of Perl Kurila, see pod/kurilaintro.pod.


INSTALLATION
============

If you're using a relatively modern operating system and want to
install this version of kurila locally, run the following commands:

  ./Configure -des -Dprefix=$HOME/localkurila
  make test
  make install

This will configure and compile perl for your platform, run the regression
tests, and install perl in a subdirectory "localkurila" of your home directory.

If you run into any trouble whatsoever or you need to install a customized
version of kurila, you should read the detailed instructions in the "INSTALL"
file that came with this distribution.  Additionally, there are a number of
"README" files with hints and tips about building and using Perl on a wide
variety of platforms, some more common than others.

Once you have kurila installed, a wealth of documentation is available to you
through the 'perldockurila' tool.  To get started, run this command:

  perldockurila perl


IF YOU RUN INTO TROUBLE
=======================

Perl is a large and complex system that's used for everything from
knitting to rocket science.  If you run into trouble, it's quite
likely that someone else has already solved the problem you're
facing. Once you've exhausted the documentation, please report bugs to us
using the 'perlbug' tool. For more information about perlbug, either type
'perldoc perlbug' or just 'perlbug' on a line by itself.

While it was current when we made it available, Perl is constantly evolving
and there may be a more recent version that fixes bugs you've run into or
adds new features that you might find useful.

You can always find the latest version of perl on a CPAN (Comprehensive Perl
Archive Network) site near you at http://www.cpan.org/src/


Just a personal note:  I want you to know that I create nice things like this
because it pleases the Author of my story.  If this bothers you, then your
notion of Authorship needs some revision.  But you can use perl anyway. :-)

For those of you that choose to use the GNU General Public License,
my interpretation of the GNU General Public License is that no Perl
script falls under the terms of the GPL unless you explicitly put
said script under the terms of the GPL yourself.  Furthermore, any
object code linked with perl does not automatically fall under the
terms of the GPL, provided such object code only adds definitions
of subroutines and variables, and does not otherwise impair the
resulting interpreter from executing any standard Perl script.  I
consider linking in C subroutines in this manner to be the moral
equivalent of defining subroutines in the Perl language itself.  You
may sell such an object file as proprietary provided that you provide
or offer to provide the Perl source, as specified by the GNU General
Public License.  (This is merely an alternate way of specifying input
to the program.)  You may also sell a binary produced by the dumping of
a running Perl script that belongs to you, provided that you provide or
offer to provide the Perl source as specified by the GPL.  (The
fact that a Perl interpreter and your code are in the same binary file
is, in this case, a form of mere aggregation.)  This is my interpretation
of the GPL.  If you still have concerns or difficulties understanding
my intent, feel free to contact me.  Of course, the Artistic License
spells all this out for your protection, so you may prefer to use that.
