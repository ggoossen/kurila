Changes for 0.16    Thu Jan 25 22:24:36 CET 2007
=================================================
* Address #23995: Version parsing code has been
  improved and now partly relies on version.pm.
  Previously, versions declared with qv() or
  ($VERSION) (note the braces) could fail to
  parse under certain conditions.
* Add 02_Parse_Version.t to specifically test for
  this behaviour.

Changes for 0.14    Wed Jan  3 18:27:36 CET 2007
=================================================
* Skip $VERSION declarations that are part of the 
  POD as reported in #24062

Changes for 0.12    Sun Aug 13 14:55:54 CEST 2006
=================================================
* Make %INC look ups work correctly under win32,
  where the directory seperator is not the same
  as the %INC path seperator
