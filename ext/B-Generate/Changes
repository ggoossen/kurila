1.09
  - Merged distributions:
    - S/SW/SWALTERS/B-Generate-1.06_1.tar.gz
      - Removed ppaddr setting for OP_LIST
      - Call Perl_fold_constants instead of fold_constants
    - M/MS/MSCHWERN/B-Generate-1.06_2.tar.gz
      - Awesome!
      - fold_constants is called w/ thread context
    - J/JJ/JJORE/B-Generate-1.07.tar.gz
      - Populates specialsv_list
    - J/JJ/JJORE/B-Generate-1.08.tar.gz
      - Nothing interesting, apparently.
    - RT #4747:
      - changes to compile for 5.8.1+ by Jim Cromie <jcromie@cpan.org>
        - altered Build.PL to add extra_compiler_flags when building for 5.8.x,
          ie: -DPERL_CUSTOM_OPS -DPERL_CUSTOM_OPCODES
          these didnt work for me under 5.6.x
        - silenced redefined warnings with $SIG{__WARN__}
        - various XS tweaks: casts, aTHX_, and Perl_ prefix on symbols
        - various pm tweaks to silence warnings

1.06 Sun Jul 28 18:43:06 CEST 2002
    - Added support for changing PV in SvPV

1.06 Tue Jul  2 14:37:43 CEST 2002
    - If PL_compcv is set, we will return that cv instead
      of trying to find the root. PL_compcv is only set
      during compilation when we only can safely work with ops
      during that compilation, and the next approach won't work
      since optree isn't complete.

1.05 Thu Jun 27 23:57:02 CEST 2002
    - Apperently we the previous release was a bit too quick.
      Sometimes the CV for the PL_eval_root doesn't have a real
      CvROOT set so we create a new fake temporary CV.

1.04 Thu Jun 27 22:41:07 CEST 2002
    - Made find_cv support working in an existing eval ""

1.00  Wed Aug 29 00:24:30 BST 2001
    - It's time for a 1.0 release, this has been tested thoroughly
      enough.
    - Support for custom ops. Oh yes.

0.07  Mon Jun  4 11:10:02 BST 2001
    - Oh, all sorts. Mainly undocumented. Added documentation about the
      undocumentation.
    - append_elem has been fixed up, and prepend_elem has been added.
    - convert and scope
    - assignment
    - constructor for conditional (if/then/else) ops. (B::LOGOP->newcond)
    - constructor for subroutines. (B::CV->newsub_simple)
    - lots of field testing with the bytecode compiler. (Shiny-Byte)

0.06  Mon May 28 18:08:12 BST 2001
    - Backed out disastrous context compilation fix
    - Fixed B::LOGOP->new and B::LISTOP->new - it was creating binops and 
      blessing them as B::BINOP. Oops!
    - Added the undocumented "append_elem" method; this is enough for
      you to create subroutine calls if you know how. I should probably
      make a "gimme a sub call" utility function.

0.05  Wed Apr 18 08:50:33 2001
    - The bastards took op_children away!
    - Fixed interpret context compilation bug

0.04  Wed Mar 21 00:18:27 2001
    - Urgh. Fixed *nasty* segfault bug. (PL_op==0x0 after ->new)
    - Added "linklist" and undocumented "clean" method
    - Added "newstate" method
    - Documentation nits

0.03  Wed Jan 10 00:21:08 2001
    - Test script needed a fix to stop ->targ pointing into never-never
      land. Not *exactly* sure why.

0.02  Fri Jan  5 13:14:29 2001
    - Added a couple more methods and tests, mainly SVOP and SV methods.

0.01  Sat Dec 23 18:00:08 2000
	- original version; created by h2xs 1.20 with options
