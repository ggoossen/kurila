      * Store compress & uncompressed sizes as 64-bit.

      * For one-shot uncompression, like this

            unzip "some.zip" => \@a, MultiStream => 1;

        Push each uncompressed stream from "some.zip" onto @a.

      * Added IO::Compress::Base::FilterEnvelope

      * Added IO::Uncompress::Base::nextStream

      * The '-' filehandle now maps to either *STDIN or *STDOUT. 
        This keeps mod_perl happier. Was using these before

            new IO::File("<-")
            new IO::File(">-")
