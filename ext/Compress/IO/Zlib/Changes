  2.000_13 20 June 2006

      * Preliminary support for reading zip files with zip64 members.

  2.000_12 3 May 2006

      * Moved the code for creating and parsing the gzip extra field into
        IO::Compress::Zlib::Extra.pm so that IO::Compress::Zip &
        IO::Uncompress::Unzip can use it as well. 

      * Added ExtraFieldLocal & ExtraFieldCentral options to IO::Compress::Zip.
        These allow the creation of user-defined extra fields in the local
        and central headers, just like the ExtraField option in
        IO::Compress::Gzip.

      * Moved the zip constants into IO::Compress::Zip::Constants

      * Added exTime option to IO::Compress::Zip. 
        This allows creation of the extended timestamp extra field.

      * Added Minimal option to IO::Compress::Zip. 
        This disables the creation of all extended fields.

      * Added TextFlag option to IO::Compress::Zip. 

      * Documented Comment and ZipComment options in IO::Compress::Zip. 

  2.000_11 10 April 2006

      * Updated Documentation for zip modules.

      * Changed IO::Compress::Zip 'Store' option to 'Method' and added
        symbolic constants ZIP_CM_STORE, ZIP_CM_DEFLATE and ZIP_CM_BZIP2 to
        allow the compression method to be picked by the user.

      * Added support to allow bzip2 compressed data to be written/read
        with IO::Compress::Zip and IO::Uncompress::Unzip.

      * Beefed up 050interop-gzip.t to check that the external gzip command
        works as expected before starting the tests. This means that
        this test harness will just be skipped on problematic systems.

      * Merged core patch 27565 from Steve Peters. This works around a
        problem with gzip on OpenBSD where it doesn't seem to like
        compressing files < 10 bytes long.

  2.000_10 13 March 2006

      * Documentation updates.

  2.000_09 3 March 2006

      * Released to CPAN.

  2.000_08 2 March 2006

      * Split IO::Compress::Zlib into its own distribution.

      * Beefed up support for zip/unzip
