  *** NOTE *** There are known failures in t/Hash.t.  These are
  due to bugs in perl's restricted hash implementation.  They have
  been left failing so Those That Know How To Fix It know where
  the bugs are.

  * Data::Util::readonly() is now sv_readonly_flag() to make its
    function less ambiguous.
  * Hash::Util::lock_key/unlock_key is now lock_value/unlock_value
    to make its functionality less ambiguous.  It also takes
    somewhat different arguments.
  * Added lock_hash(), unlock_hash().
