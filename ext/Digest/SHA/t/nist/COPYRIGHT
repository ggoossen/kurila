The files in this directory were extracted from the "sha1-vectors.zip"
archive, which is publicly available through the National Institute
of Standards and Technology (NIST) website at the following URL:

	http://csrc.nist.gov/cryptval/shs.html

The files have been truncated to include only the first 10 test
cases for bit and byte messages.  This was done solely to decrease
the size of the module distribution, thereby making downloads much
quicker for users.  If a more extensive test run is desired, simply
replace these files by the originals from the above URL.

NIST advises that the archive file describes "tests and vectors
that can be used to informally verify the correctness of an SHA-1
implementation.  However, use of these vectors does not take the
place of validation obtained through the Cryptographic Module
Validation Program."
