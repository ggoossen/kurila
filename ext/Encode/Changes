+ lib/Encode/Description.pod
! lib/Encode/Encoding.pm
  Now the pod in Encode.pm is abridged as programming references.
  lib/Encode/Description.pod contains the original, detailed description
  and Encode::Encoding explains how to write your own module to
  add new encodings.  So far, lib/Encode/Description.pod contains
  the whole pod once in Encode.pm.  This is intentional.
