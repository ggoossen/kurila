0.95  Thu Mar 22 2002
  In this update, pod rewrites and alias fixes are the main issues
+ lib/Encode/Supported.pod
  Describes supported encodings
! Makefile.PL
  streamlined compiled-in encodings.
! lib/Encode/Description.pod -> lib/Encode/Details.pod
  Renamed.
+ Encode/ibm-125?.ucm
  Added from icu distibution with any occurance of
   "IBM-125?" to "cp125?".  Filenames remain unchanged to pay
   some respect to icu staff, however.
+ lib/Encode/Alias.pm
! Encode.pm
  Alias difinitions in Encode.pm relocated.
! AUTHORS
! Encode.xs
  packWARN patch from Paul Marquess via jhi
  Message-Id: <20020321010101.O28978@alpha.hut.fi>
  Paul added to AUTHORS as a result.
! t/CJKalias.t -> t/Aliases.t
  Renamed.  Checks even more aliases and alias overloading
! Encode.pm
! CN/CN.pm
  duplicate alias for ujis => euc-jp removed (Encode::JP has one)
  gbk => cp936 relocated to CN.pm
! t/CJKalias.t
  Test::More with plans (by jhi)
0.94  Thu Mar 21 2002
+ lib/Encode/Description.pod
! lib/Encode/Encoding.pm
  Now the pod in Encode.pm is abridged as programming references.
  lib/Encode/Description.pod contains the original, detailed description
  and Encode::Encoding explains how to write your own module to
  add new encodings.  So far, lib/Encode/Description.pod contains
  the whole pod once in Encode.pm.  This is intentional.
! Encode.pm
  Pod revisions by Anton Tagunov
  Message-Id: <517178431.20020320174824@motor.ru>
! lib/Encode/Tcl.pm
  all occrance of Encode::Tcl::Extended removed including pod
! t/CJKalias.t
  test now checks $encoding->name only; $encoding->{name} are
  no longer check to find the canonical name.
! lib/Encode/JP/JIS.pm
! lib/Encode/JP/ISO_2022_JP.pm
  ->name() added to be more compliant with API  
! CN/CN.pm
! JP/JP.pm
! KR/KR.pm
! TW/TW.pm
! t/CJKalias.t
  Patch by Autrijus to add aliases to TW and fixes to POD
  Message-Id: <20020320090619.GA24774@not.autrijus.org>
! AUTHORS
  SADAHIRO Tomoyuki added as should.  My apologies.
