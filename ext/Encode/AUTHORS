# To give due honor to those who have made Encode module  what is is today,
# here are easily-from-changelogs-extractable people and their
# (hopefully) current and preferred email addresses (as of early 2001,
# if known).
#
# The use of this database for anything else than Encode and/or Perl 
# development is strictly forbidden.  (Passive distribution with the Perl 
# source code kit is naturally allowed.)
#
# This list is in alphabetical order.
