   modules in a directory with the PERL_APIVERSION version number.  
   Normally this should not change across maintenance releases.
   perl.c:incpush() and lib/lib.pm will automatically search older 
   directories across major versions back to to PERL_XS_APIVERSION
   for XS modules and back to PERL_PM_APIVERSION for pure PERL modules.
   (Since the versioned directory layout didn't start until 5.005,
   that's the earliest these can go back.

   See INSTALL for how this works.

/*
	local_patches -- list of locally applied less-than-subversion patches.
	If you're distributing such a patch, please give it a name and a
	one-line description, placed just before the last NULL in the array
	below.  If your patch fixes a bug in the perlbug database, please
	mention the bugid.  If your patch *IS* dependent on a prior patch,
	please place your applied patch line after its dependencies. This
	will help tracking of patch dependencies.

	Please edit the hunk of diff which adds your patch to this list,
	to remove context lines which would give patch problems.  For instance,
	if the original context diff is
	   *** patchlevel.h.orig	<date here>
	   --- patchlevel.h	<date here>
	   *** 38,43 ***
	   --- 38,44 ---
	     	,"FOO1235 - some patch"
	     	,"BAR3141 - another patch"
	     	,"BAZ2718 - and another patch"
	   + 	,"MINE001 - my new patch"
	     	,NULL
	     };
	
	please change it to 
	   *** patchlevel.h.orig	<date here>
	   --- patchlevel.h	<date here>
	   *** 41,43 ***
	   --- 41,44 ---
	   + 	,"MINE001 - my new patch"
	     };
	
	(Note changes to line numbers as well as removal of context lines.)
	This will prevent patch from choking if someone has previously
	applied different patches than you.
