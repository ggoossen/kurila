=head1 NAME

README.irix - Perl version 5 on Irix systems

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This document describes various features of Irix that will affect how Perl
version 5 (hereafter just Perl) is compiled and/or runs.

=head2 Building 32-bit Perl in Irix

Use

	sh Configure -Dcc='cc -n32'

to compile Perl 32-bit.  Don't bother with -n32 unless you have 7.1
or later compilers (use cc -version to check).

(Building 'cc -n32' is the default.)

=head2 Building 64-bit Perl in Irix

Use
	
	sh Configure -Dcc='cc -64'

to compiler Perl 64-bit.

=head2 About Compiler Versions of Irix

Some Irix cc versions, e.g. 7.3.1.1m (try cc -version) have been known
to have issues (coredumps) when compiling perl.c.  If you've used
-OPT:fast_io=ON and this happens, try removing it.  If that fails, or
you didn't use that, then try adjusting other optimization options
(-LNO, -INLINE, -O3 to -O2, etcetera).  The compiler bug has been
reported to SGI.  (Allen Smith <easmith@beatrice.rutgers.edu>)

=head2 Linker Problems in Irix

If you get complaints about so_locations then search in the file
hints/irix_6.sh for "lddflags" and do the suggested adjustments.
(David Billinghurst <David.Billinghurst@riotinto.com.au>)

=head2 Malloc in Irix

Do not try to use Perl's malloc, this will lead into very mysterious
errors (especially with -Duse64bitall).

=head2 Building with threads

For Irix 6.2, you have to have the following patches installed:

        1404 Irix 6.2 Posix 1003.1b man pages
        1645 Irix 6.2 & 6.3 POSIX header file updates
        2000 Irix 6.2 Posix 1003.1b support modules
        2254 Pthread library fixes
        2401 6.2 all platform kernel rollup

IMPORTANT: Without patch 2401, a kernel bug in Irix 6.2 will cause
your machine to panic and crash when running threaded perl.  Irix 6.3
and later are okay.
