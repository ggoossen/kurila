Merging
    oneperl (THIS pointer)

Multi-threading
    $AUTOLOAD. Hmm.
    without USE_THREADS, change extern variable for dTHR
    consistent semantics for exit/die in threads
    SvREFCNT_dec(curstack) in threadstart() in Thread.xs
    Thread::Pool
    more Configure support

Miscellaneous
    rename and alter ISA.pm
    magic_setisa should be made to update %FIELDS

Compiler
    auto-produce executable
    typed lexicals should affect B::CC::load_pad
    workarounds to help Win32
    $^C to track compiler/checker status
    END blocks need saving in compiled output
    _AUTOLOAD prodding
    fix comppadlist (names in comppad_name can have fake SvCUR
	from where newASSIGNOP steals the field)

Documentation
    lots
