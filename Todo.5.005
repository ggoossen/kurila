Multi-threading
    $AUTOLOAD. Hmm.
    without USE_THREADS, change extern variable for dTHR
    consistent semantics for exit/die in threads
    SvREFCNT_dec(curstack) in threadstart() in Thread.xs
    better support for externally created threads
    Thread::Pool
    more Configure support
    spot-check globals like statcache and global GVs for thread-safety

Compiler
    auto-produce executable
    typed lexicals should affect B::CC::load_pad
    workarounds to help Win32
    $^C to track compiler/checker status
    END blocks need saving in compiled output
    _AUTOLOAD prodding
    fix comppadlist (names in comppad_name can have fake SvCUR
	from where newASSIGNOP steals the field)

Namespace cleanup
    symbol-space: "pl_" prefix for all global vars
                  "Perl_" prefix for all functions
    CPP-space:	  restrict what we export from headers
                  stop malloc()/free() pollution unless asked
    header-space: move into CORE/perl/
    API-space:    begin list of things that constitute public api

MULTIPLICITY support
    complete work on safe recursive interpreters, C<Perl->new()>

Configure
    installation layout changes to avoid overwriting old versions

Reliable Signals
    alternate runops() for signal despatch
    figure out how to die() in delayed sighandler
    add tests for Thread::Signal

Win32 stuff
    automate maintenance of most PERL_OBJECT code
    get PERL_OBJECT building under gcc
    rename new headers to be consistent with the rest
    sort out the spawnvp() mess
    work out DLL versioning
    put perlobject in $ARCHNAME so it can coexist with rest
    get PERL_OBJECT building on non-win32?
    style-check

Miscellaneous
    rename and alter ISA.pm
    magic_setisa should be made to update %FIELDS [???]
    be generous in accepting foreign line terminations
    make filenames 8.3 friendly, where feasible
    upgrade to newer versions of all independently maintained modules
    add new modules (Data-Dumper, Storable?)
    test it with large parts of CPAN
    fix pod2html to generate relative URLs

Documentation
    comprehensive perldelta.pod
    describe new age patterns
    update perl{guts,call,embed,xs} with additions, changes to API
    document Win32 choices
    rework INSTALL to reflect changes in installation structure
    spot-check all new modules for completeness
    better docs for pack()/unpack()
    add perlport.pod
