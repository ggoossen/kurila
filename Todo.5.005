Merging
    oneperl (THIS pointer)

Multi-threading
    $AUTOLOAD. Hmm.
    without USE_THREADS, change extern variable for dTHR
    consistent semantics for exit/die in threads
    SvREFCNT_dec(curstack) in threadstart() in Thread.xs
    $@ and other magic globals:
	global pseudo-lexical pad with auto-binding for magicals
	move magicals that should be per-thread into thread.h
	sv_magic for the necessary global pad entries
    Thread::Pool
    more Configure support

Miscellaneous
    rename and alter ISA.pm
    magic_setisa should be made to update %FIELDS

Compiler
    auto-produce executable
    typed lexicals should affect B::CC::load_pad
    workarounds to help Win32
    $^C to track compiler/checker status
    END blocks need saving in compiled output
    _AUTOLOAD prodding

Documentation
    lots
