Summary
-------

This is a patch set which adds cross-compilation to the perl
buildsystem.  It was built as a part of the Open Zaurus
(http://www.openzaurus.com/) distribution.  Most / All of the
optimisations are "borrowed" from this excellent project.

The main target is arm-linux but I have also managed to
successfully cross-compile perl for solaris x86 using the same
buildsystem.

We are currently dependent on an existing working local copy of
perl which is available as /usr/bin/perl.  This could be migrated
to using native miniperl with some additional effort.

Obviously you need a working and tested cross-compiler for your
build and target combination.  The binary directory must be in
your path.

1)	You should be reading me (README) in perl-5.x.x/Cross

2)	Make sure you are in the Cross directory.

3)	Edit the file 'config' to contain your target platform information.

4)	make patch	## This will patch the existing source-tree.
5)	make perl	## Will make perl

The Obvious Ommissions
----------------------

This does NOT perform any installation as site installation method will
be dependant on the target arch and OS. 

make test will NOT work as the binaries and libraries will not execute.

Due to space limitations on the Zaurus (it's a PDA) we do not provide
documentation in the core - Therefore man pages are not even generated.

	Note that the Cross/ directory is also used by a different
	cross-compilation setup described in the INSTALL file, and
	executed by Configure.  There should be no conflicts since
	it is unlikely both that cross-compilation setups are used
	simultaneously.

Enjoy!
