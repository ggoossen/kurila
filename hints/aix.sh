# Contact dfavor@corridor.com for any of the following:
#
#    - AIX 43x and above support
#    - gcc + threads support
#    - socks support
#
# Apr 99 changes:
#
#    - use nm in AIX 43x and above
#    - gcc + threads now builds
#    [(added support for socks) Jul 99 SOCKS support rewritten]
#
# Notes:
#
#    - shared libperl support is tricky. if ever libperl.a ends up
#      in /usr/local/lib/* it can override any subsequent builds of
#      that same perl release. to make sure you know where the shared
#      libperl.a is coming from do a 'dump -Hv perl' and check all the
#      library search paths in the loader header.
#
#      it would be nice to warn the user if a libperl.a exists that is
#      going to override the current build, but that would be complex.
#
#      better yet, a solid fix for this situation should be developed.
#

# Configure finds setrgid and setruid, but they're useless.  The man
# pages state:
#    setrgid: The EPERM error code is always returned.
#    setruid: The EPERM error code is always returned. Processes cannot
#             reset only their real user IDs.
