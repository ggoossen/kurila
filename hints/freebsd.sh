# The two flags "-fpic -DPIC" are used to indicate a
# will-be-shared object.  Configure will guess the -fpic, (and the
# -DPIC is not used by perl proper) but the full define is included to 
# be consistent with the FreeBSD general shared libs building process.
#
# setreuid and friends are inherently broken in all versions of FreeBSD
# before 2.1-current (before approx date 4/15/95). It is fixed in 2.0.5
# and what-will-be-2.1

Some users have reported that Configure halts when testing for
the O_NONBLOCK symbol with a syntax error.  This is apparently a
sh error.  Rerunning Configure with ksh apparently fixes the
problem.  Try
	ksh Configure [your options]
