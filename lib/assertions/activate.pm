=head1 NAME

assertions::activate - activate assertions

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use assertions::activate 'Foo', 'bar', 'Foo::boz::.*';

  # activate all assertions
  use assertions::activate;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module is used internally by perl (and its C<-A> command-line switch) to
enable and disable assertions.

Though it can also be explicetly used:

  use assertions::activate qw(foo bar);

The import parameters are a list of strings or of regular expressions. The
assertion tags that match those regexps are enabled. If no parameter is
given, all assertions are activated.
