How to build me:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test

There's a very small chance that the tests in speed.t and
expire_module_t.t might fail because of clock skew or bizarre system
load conditions.  If the tests there fail, rerun them and see if the
problem persists.

If the tests work,

	make install

If not, please send me a report that mentions which tests failed.
The address is: mjd-perl-memoize+@plover.com.

I'm sorry about this.  I hate making incompatible changes.  But as of
v0.65, Memoize is included in the Perl core.  It is about to become
much more difficult to make incompatible interface changes; if I don't
get rid of TIE now, I may not get another chance.

TIE presented serious problems.  First, it had a bizarre syntax.  But
the big problem was that it was difficult and complicated for
expiration manager authors to support; evern expiration manager had to
duplicate the logic for handling TIE.  HASH is much simpler to use,
more powerful, and is trivial for expiration managers to support.

Many long-awaited cleanups and bug fixes. 

Memoize now works under threaded perl

Slow tests speeded up.  More test file improvements.

Long-standing LIST_CACHE bug cleared up---it turns out that there
never was a bug.  I put in tests for it anyway.

Manual increased.
