This directory contains the Unicode Character Database
data files.

Currently, the Unicode Character Database files are at
the version level:

   Unicode Standard, Version 3.1.

For information about the standard itself, see
UAX #27, Unicode 3.1. <http://www.unicode.org/unicode/reports/tr27/>

Detailed documentation of the files constituting the
Unicode Character Database (contributory data files for
the standard itself) can now be found in
UnicodeCharacterDatabase.html. See also UnicodeData.html,
PropList.html, NamesList.html, and DerivedProperties.html
for specific details about particular files or sets of
files.

Unihan.txt is a very large file. For convenience, the current
Unicode 3.1 version of Unihan.txt is also available in
three compressed formats in the Unicode 3.1 update directory.
See: <http://www.unicode.org/Public/3.1-Update/> or
<ftp://ftp.unicode.org/Public/3.1-Update/>

Unihan-3.1.zip for Windows. (Use winzip)
Unihan-3.1.Z   for Unix.    (Use uncompress)
Unihan-3.1.gz  for Unix.    (Use gzip)

The Unicode 3.1 update directory also contains a winzip
version of all the other contributory data files for
that update directory. That file is named:

UCDwithoutUnihan.zip        (Use winzip)

UCDwithoutUnihan.zip is a convenient way to download
most of the Unicode Character Database files, but to
be complete, be sure to also get ArabicShaping.txt,
BidiMirroring.txt, and Jamo.txt, which were unchanged
between Unicode 3.0.1 and Unicode 3.1, and which were
therefore not included in the 3.1-Update directory.

Note that the files are zipped in
exactly the same format they have on the server (with Unix
line endings). From a browser, right-clicking on 
UCDwithoutUnihan.zip will allow automatic download and unzipping on a
Windows system with winzip installed.
