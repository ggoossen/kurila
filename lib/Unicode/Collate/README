Unicode/Collate version 0.50
===============================

NAME

  Unicode::Collate - Unicode Collation Algorithm

SYNOPSIS

  use Unicode::Collate;

  #construct
  $Collator = Unicode::Collate->new(%tailoring);

  #sort
  @sorted = $Collator->sort(@not_sorted);

  #compare
  $result = $Collator->cmp($a, $b); # returns 1, 0, or -1.
  $result = $Collator->eq($a, $b);  # returns true/false
    (similarly ->ne, ->lt, ->le, ->gt, ->ge)

INSTALLATION

Perl 5.6.1 or later is required.
Perl 5.8.1 or later is recommended.

To use this module, it is recommended to install a table file
in the UCA format, by copying it into the directory
where Unicode/Collate.pm is installed;
e.g., into perl/lib/Unicode/Collate/ directory
if you will have perl/lib/Unicode/Collate.pm.

You can install such a table file by adding it
to "Collate" directory (where "keys.txt" is placed) in this distribution
before executing Makefile.PL.

The most preferable one is "The Default Unicode Collation Element Table",
available from the Unicode Consortium's website:

  http://www.unicode.org/Public/UCA/

  http://www.unicode.org/Public/UCA/latest/allkeys.txt (latest version)

Though this distribution contains a subset of allkeys.txt, named "keys.txt",
this one is intended only for doing a test of this module
and practically useless for any other purpose.

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

(!! XSUB for Unicode::Collate is an EXPERIMENTAL support !!)
If you have a C compiler and want to use XSUB edition,
type the following (!! "enableXS" must run before "Makefile.PL" !!):

   perl enableXS
   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

If you decide to install pure Perl (i.e. non-XS) edition after trying
to build XSUB, type the following:

   make clean
   perl disableXS
   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DEPENDENCIES

  The conformant collation requires Unicode::Normalize (v 0.10 or later)
  although Unicode::Collate can be used without Unicode::Normalize.
