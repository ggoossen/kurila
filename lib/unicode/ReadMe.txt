This directory contains the beta files for the minor release 
Unicode 3.1.

This release consists of corrections and additions to the
Unicode Character Database for the Unicode Standard, 
Version 3.1.

Detailed documentation of the files constituting the
Unicode Character Database (contributory data files for
the standard itself) can now be found in
UnicodeCharacterDatabase.html. See also UnicodeData.html,
PropList.html, NamesList.html, and DerivedProperties.html
for specific details about particular files or sets of
files.

Unihan-3.1.txt is a very large file, so it is also provided in
three different compressed formats:

Unihan-3.1.zip for Windows. (Use winzip)
Unihan-3.1.Z   for Unix.    (Use uncompress)
Unihan-3.1.gz  for Unix.    (Use gzip)

UCDwithoutUnihan.zip is a Windows winzip file that contains
all of the Unicode Character Database files except
Unihan-3.1.txt and this ReadMe.txt file. This file is
provided for convenience when downloading files from the
Unicode Character Database. Note that the files are zipped in
exactly the same format they have on the server (with Unix
line endings). From a browser, right-clicking on this file
entry will allow automatic download and unzipping on a
Windows system with winzip installed.
