*** Missing version history to be extracted from Perl changes ***


1.07  Fri Feb 23 1996 by Andreas Koenig
    - Gisle sent me a documentation patch that showed me, that the
      unless(/^#/) is unnessessary. Applied the patch and deleted the block
      checking for "comment" lines. -- All lines are comment lines that do
      not match /^1\.\.([0-9]+)/ or /^(not\s+)?ok\b/.
    - Ilyaz request to print "ok (empty test case)" whenever we say 1..0
      implemented.
    - Harness now doesn't abort anymore if we received confused test output,
      just warns instead.

1.05  Wed Jan 31 1996 by Andreas Koenig
    - More updates on docu and introduced the liberality that the script
      output may omit the test numbers.

1.03  Mon January 28 1996 by Andreas Koenig
    - Added the statistics for subtests. Updated the documentation.

1.02  by Andreas Koenig
    - This version reports a list of the tests that failed accompanied by
      some trivial statistics. The older (unnumbered) version stopped
      processing after the first failed test.
    - Additionally it reports the exit status if there is one.
