----------------
Version 5.003_20
----------------

The only language change in this release is the recension of support
for named closures:  Now, no subroutine declared "sub foo {}" can be
a closure.  (This is a return to the behavior of 5.003.)  In addition,
there are new warnings triggered by any apparent attempt to use named
functions as closures.

And, as usual, there are the usual little fixes, documentation
updates, and expanded tests.  This is good stuff.  "I love you, man!"

----------------
Version 5.003_19
----------------

Lots of internal cleanup in this patch, especially plugged memory
leaks when embedded Perl interpreters shut down and restart.  The
method cache is now invisible to user code.  And there is a new test
directory, "t/pragma".

IMHO, this is Beta quality code.

Here's a list of the more significant changes...

This release is strictly a bug fix -- it removes some function caching
changes that were supposed to be improvements, but weren't.

----------------
Version 5.003_07
----------------

This patch was primarily to fix bugs or include little things I missed
in 5.003_06.  5.003_07 is intended to be stable enough to merit serious
testing with an eye towards eventual release as 5.004.

If it doesn't work for you, try

	LC_ALL=C; export LC_ALL

for Bourne shell users, or 

	setenv LC_ALL C

for C-shell users.  Some versions of IRIX are reported to have
problems with sort when the locale is other than C.  This manifests
as an infinite loop in the ./miniperl configpm step.

The details are described below.  A very brief summary is:

o Visible Changes to Core Functionality

   -Support for BER compressed integers.  See perlfunc.pod for
    documentation on the 'w' option.

   -untaint support added to IO extension.
    
o Changes in Core Internals

   -Perl's realloc is once again called 'Myremalloc' (with -DHIDEMYMALLOC),
    as it was pre-5.003_01.  Again, this is for binary compatibility
    with 5.003.  (5.003_06 erroneously called it Myrealloc.)

   -Getopt::Long updated to version 2.4.

o Configure and build enhancements

   -improved SCO hints.  Actually these are unconfirmed guesses, but
    they may be right.

   -OS/2 and Plan9 updates.

o Bug fixes

    -print sort (4,1,3,2);

    -group numbers are integers again.

    -other things.  See the specific changes for details.

o Specific Changes

Here are the specific file-by-file changes.

Index: Changes

    Updated for 5.003_07.

    Fixed a spelling error.

Index: Configure

    Detect GNU libc (thanks, Skimo!) and avoid nm if we have GNU libc.
    Since the GNU libc test requires compiling and linking a test
    program, the dependencies have been altered and lots of pieces of
    Configure have moved around unchanged.  The patch is big but the
    effect is little.

    Allow for both <sys/select.h> and <time.h> in fd_set tests.
    Systems which don't allow both (e.g. SCO) have to turn off one
    or the other in the hints file for now.

Index: INSTALL

    Warn about re-using config.sh version-specific values.

Index: MANIFEST

    Date: Tue, 8 Oct 1996 22:24:48 -0400
    From: "Randy J. Ray" <rjray@uswest.com>
    Subject: PATCH: untaint method for IO::Handle, 5.003_06 version

    This is a re-post of my patch to Graham's IO library to add a method in
    IO::Handle called "untaint", that sets the IOf_UNTAINT flag on an object
    that is of or inherits from IO::Handle. With this flag set, data read from
    said handle is not tainted, whether running under -T, suid or sgid.

    This patch adds the method to IO.xs, adds documentation and warning to the
    pod of IO/Handle.pm, creates a new test in t/lib called io_taint.t, and
    adds mention of the new file to MANIFEST.

    Add mention of t/lib/io_taint.t

    Subject: PATCH: untaint method for IO::Handle, 5.003_06 version

    This is a re-post of my patch to Graham's IO library to add a method in
    IO::Handle called "untaint", that sets the IOf_UNTAINT flag on an object
    that is of or inherits from IO::Handle. With this flag set, data read from
    said handle is not tainted, whether running under -T, suid or sgid.

    This patch adds the method to IO.xs, adds documentation and warning to the
    pod of IO/Handle.pm, creates a new test in t/lib called io_taint.t, and
    adds mention of the new file to MANIFEST.

    This broke between 5.001n and 5.002.  There was a long winded thread
    about sorting undefs in some order (rather than coredumping) around
    the 5.002beta times (search for "bogorefs" in the subject-line on
    p5p archive for details). Larry added in some code that presumes that
    the private flags are set by the time qsort() is called:

    Unfortunately, sv_2pv() does not set the POKp flag, so the above
    code breaks!  Here's a patch against 5.00306.

----------------
Version 5.003_06
----------------

This patch was primarily to fix bugs, improve the documentation,
and work towards restoring binary compatibility with 5.003.
The details are described below.  A very brief summary is:

o Visible Changes to Core Functionality

   -Significantly improved support _with documentation_ for
    locales, including LC_COLLATE.  See the new pod/perli18n.pod.
    Thanks to Jarkko Hietaniemi.

   -new version of Math::Complex, with test suite.  Ought to be
    backwards compatible, but check it out if you use Math::Complex.

   -Pre-extending hashes now works.  keys %hash = 5000 will pre-size
    %hash.

   -__DATA__ filehandle is untainted.

o Changes in Core Internals

   -gv_fullname and gv_efullname have reverted to their pre-5.003_03
    versions for binary compatibility.  Actually, they are implemented
    as stubs pointing to the new 3-argument forms gv_fullname3 and
    gv_efullname3.

   -Perl's malloc is once again called 'Mymalloc' (with -DHIDEMYMALLOC),
    as it was pre-5.003_01.  Again, this is for binary compatibility
    with 5.003.

o Configure and build enhancements

   -many new tests for the standard library.

   -test suite now locale-friendly.

   -a2p.man and s2p.man now made into pods.

o Bug fixes

   -whitespace lexer errors fixed.

   -many, many other things.  See details below.

o Specific Changes

Here are the specific file-by-file changes.

This is patch perl5.003_06.pat to perl version 5.003_05.
This takes you from 5.003_05 to 5.003_06.

To apply this patch, run the above commands,
cd to your perl source directory and then type

	patch -p1 -N < perl5.003_06.pat

The changes are described after each /^Index:/ line below.  This is
designed so you can examine each change with a command such as

	csplit -k perl5.003_06.pat '/^Index:/' '{999}'

(Of course, since there are more than 100 Index entries, your
csplit may complain, since many csplit's have an arbitrary limit of 100
files.  Still, you can manually split the file or roll your own.)

    Subject: Re: pre extending hash? - need speed

    The patch below (which is relative to perl5.001l) implements
    "keys %hash = 50_000;" (or other integer-evaluable sizes) for
    pre-sizing hashes.  I've only moved the patch forward from
    when I first did it.  I'm sure the code in hv_ksplit could be
    improved.

    I found a subtle problem with the lazydelete mechanism (which is used
    to postpone the delete of a entry that may be getting iterated over).
    I was using the HeKLEN slot to hold the hint, but the real HeKLEN is
    needed later to call unsharepvn().  This means that only magical
    hash entries can use the HeKLEN slot to hold flags.

    Here's a tested patch against 5.00305 that fixes the problem.
    The patch simply moves the LAZYDEL hint to become a SV-level private
    flag.

    of tr/A-Z/a-z/.  This will make folding of non-english letters work if
    the locale is set up correctly.

    Here is a patch for various typos and other defects in the Perl
    5.003_05 pods, including the pods embedded in library modules.

    Bugs found in pod2man

    The following bugs were noticed, and some fixed:

    1. Where a L<> link extends over more than one line, pod2man does not
    treat it as a link but displays it literally, and so these have been
    rearranged to place the link on one line.  This is the only bug worked
    around.  [Fixed; the rearrangements, which were done beforehand,
    remain in some cases, but are no longer necessary, and pod paragraphs
    can now be safely reformatted to whatever width is desired in the pod,
    without breaking links.]

    2. It seems to swallow spaces after certain links: for example, part
    of the "open" entry in the perlfunc manpage comes out as "the
    \f(CWbinmode\fR entry elsewhere in this documentfor tips", the source
    having been "L</binmode> for tips".  [Fixed.]

    3. 'L</"Pass by Reference">', in perlsub.pod, comes out as '\fI/"Pass
    by Reference\fR', that is, with an initial '/"'.

    4. If a pod line begins with ".", nothing is done to prevent [tng]roff
    from treating it as a [tng]roff instruction.

    5. When the paragraph below =head1 NAME has more than one line, this
    confuses pod2man: so in the case of Term::Readline, the manpage begins
    with a stray line 'no real package is found, substitutes stubs instead
    of basic functions."'.

    Of course, it would be better to fix pod2man; I hope that the new Pod
    modules, when ready, will not have these defects.

    reason. Lastly, it patches toke.c to automatically set this flag on
    on a __DATA__ filehandle. The creation of the $pack::DATA
    pseudo-filehandle is already checked against running under eval, so
    this should not introduce any insecurity.

    Subject: Patch to patch for untainting

    The following patch ensures that a glob used as a filehandle that
    has had the UNTAINT flag set will not carry that flag over on a
    re-open. In a nutshell, a re-open of the DATA filehandle would be
    considered untainted, and an object of class IO::Handle (or one of
    its sub-classes) that is marked untainted with the untaint method,
    then closed and re-opened, retained the untaintedness.

    From: Spider Boardman

    First, with IO::untaint, the patches as posted resulted in a
    miniperl which couldn't open files, so the autosplitting of the
    library and the creation of Makefiles for the extensions didn't
    work.  Worse, it didn't just fail to open files, it dumped core.

    Subject: Re: "Attempt to free non-existent shared string"? (with patch)

    I found a subtle problem with the lazydelete mechanism (which is used
    to postpone the delete of a entry that may be getting iterated over).
    I was using the HeKLEN slot to hold the hint, but the real HeKLEN is
    needed later to call unsharepvn().  This means that only magical
    hash entries can use the HeKLEN slot to hold flags.

    Here's a tested patch against 5.00305 that fixes the problem.
    The patch simply moves the LAZYDEL hint to become a SV-level private
    flag.

    This patch adds a IOf_UNTAINT flag in sv.h, as one of the possibles
    on an xpvio->xio_flags struct member. It is used to mark the given
    file handle as a clean source, even when tainting is turned on.
    There are also patches to pp_sys.c in pp_sysread to check this flag
    before tainting data, and in pp_hot.c in do_readline for the same
    reason. Lastly, it patches toke.c to automatically set this flag on
    on a __DATA__ filehandle. The creation of the $pack::DATA
    pseudo-filehandle is already checked against running under eval, so
    this should not introduce any insecurity.

    This patch *does not*:

    * Add the "untaint" keyword.

    The h2xs that is in perl5.003_05 has a regexp bug which prevents it from

    fixes that.  The h2xs_test program found this--maybe people who are
    modifying h2xs should get a copy of the test program.

    This also adds a -d to enable debugging messages (there's just one for now).
    I've also placed some of the doc-related things in alphabetical order.

    h2xs_test can be found in my directory on CPAN.  Those of you modifying
    xsubpp should know there's a test suite for that, too, called XSTEST which
    can also be found in my directory on CPAN.

----------------
Version 5.003_05
----------------

This patch was primarily to fix bugs and to clean up some of
the remaining issues from in 5.003_04.  The details are described below.
A very brief summary is:

o Visible Changes to Core Functionality

   -Add support for a READLINE method to tied filehandles.

   -times function now uses CLK_TCK if HZ is not available, rather
    than just defaulting to 60.  times output might change on some
    systems, but should be correct now.

   -AnyDBM_File (modifying ISA does not work as expected)
    Now behaves as documented:  Modifying ISA works to select
    order in which *DB* modules are tried.  The default is still
    the same.

o Configure and build enhancements

   -Enhance detection of [gs]etpgrp() variants.  Some systems have
    BSD-style behavior for one and POSIX for the other.  Use
    [gs]etpgid() instead, whenever possible.

   -You can now build a shared libperl.so without running through
    the LD_RUN_PATH hoops, if your system supports appropriate
    ld command-line options.  Solaris, NetBSD, and Linux are currently
    supported.  Others are easy to add.  (This makes like a lot easier
    for embedders.)

   -VMS updates.

   -Fix installperl and installman so that the -n option really only
    prints commands.  (previously, it would still do the mkdirs.)

o Bug fixes

   -debugger ought to work.

   -A new heredoc tag in Makefile.SH is now quoted.  This prevented
    5.003_04 from working most places.

   -numerous smaller ones, detailed below.

o Specific Changes

Here are the specific file-by-file changes.

# This is my patch perl5.003_05.pat to perl5.003_04
# The full description is below.
# Please execute the following commands before applying this patch.
# (You can feed this patch to 'sh' to do so.)

# We'll create a new test, but patch won't automatically make it
# executable.

This is patch perl5.003_05.pat to perl version 5.003_04.
This takes you from 5.003_04 to 5.003_05.

To apply this patch, run the above commands,
cd to your perl source directory and then type

	patch -p1 -N < perl5.003_05.pat

The changes are described after each /^Index/ line below.  This is
designed so you can examine each change with a command such as

	csplit -k perl5.003_05.pat '/^Index:/' '{99}'

Index: Changes

    Updated for 5.003_05.

Index: Configure

    Allow command line or hint-file overrides of $afs.

    Allow trailing spaces in nm output for HPUX10.

    Check for newer BIND 'search' directives in /etc/resolv.conf as well
    as older 'domain' directive.

    Enhance detection of [gs]etpgrp() variants.  Some systems have
    BSD-style behavior for one and POSIX for the other.  Use
    [gs]etpgid() instead, whenever possible.

    Include -s in the -h summary of available options.

    Allow command-line override of $afs.

    Handle trailing spaces in nm-output on HPUX10.

    Set shrpenv for handling LD_RUN_PATH, if needed. (This used to
    be in Makefile.SH.  Now it's available for other modules too.)

    When using shared libperl, avoid LD_RUN_PATH if possible by adding
    correct ld flags.  Currently, Solaris and NetBSD get the correct
    -R $archlibexp/CORE, and Linux gets its
    -Wl,-rpath,$archlibexp/CORE flag.  Other contributions are
    welcome.

    somewhere else in the script and be hard to track down.  It is
    a failure if perl can't open AnyDBM_File.  The test regression
    suite is supposed to indicate this as a failure too.

----------------
Version 5.003_04
----------------

This patch was primarily to fix bugs and to clean up some of
the changes made in 5.003_03.  The details are described below.
A very brief summary is:

o Visible Changes to Core Functionality

   -Allow and document permissions for FileHandle::new and
    IO::File::new.
   -glob in Safe compartment used to allow shell access; now
    it's in the same category as `` and system().

o Configure and build enhancements

   -perl library name is again -lperl, not -lperl5 in some cases.
   -Several hint files no longer set -g -DDEBUGGING by default.
    Instead, they just turn off optimization, since that is
    probably what was intended.
   -Include OS/2 and Plan9 updates.

o Bug fixes

   -SEGV with $_[0] and circular references fixed.
   -Ilya's debugger patch.
   -FAKE typeglobs fixed.
   -truncate with file name now works.
   -lval substr() no longer coredumps with refs
   -lval substr now clears lexicals in re-entered scopes.
   -core dump in caller() for signal handler for __DIE__.

o Specific Changes

Here are the specific file-by-file changes.

cd to your perl source directory and then type

	patch -p1 -N < perl5.003_04.pat

The changes are described after each /^Index/ line below.  This is
designed so you can examine each change with a command such as

	csplit -k perl5.003_04.pat '/^Index:/' '{99}'

Index: handy.h

    Subject: Patch for LONG_MAX & co.

    Sorry about adding yet another #ifdef forest, but hopefully this
    should resolve the *_MAX issues permanently. It adds to the
    previously defined PERL_LONG_MAX, PERL_LONG_MIN, and PERL_ULONG_MAX
    symbols the complete set of
    /PERL_U?(CHAR|SHORT|INT|LONG)_(MAX|MIN)/, and installs aliases to
    those from /(I|U)(8|16|32|V)_(MAX|MIN)/ so that for any standard
    Perl typedef, like I32 or UV, you can reference I32_MAX or UV_MIN,
    and get appropriate figures. All references to LONG_(MIN|MAX) are
    changed appropriately.

    The .c changes have the side effect of making cast_uv properly use quad
    limits if quads are in use, but longs aren't 64 bit. Hopefully this all
    works, but I don't have any handy Crays to try it out on.

    Add notes on perl's internal types, specifically Quad_t and IV.

	    /opt/perl5.003_03/lib/perl5db.pl line 1423.

    in %SIG.

Index: malloc.c

    A patch to perl5.003_02/malloc to give a sensible error abort() message
    in ANSI C, and to give it to stderr instead of stdout.

    Use config_h's STRINGIFY macro instead of pre-ANSI "p".

Index: mg.c

    Subject: FAKE typeglobs seriously busted (with patch)

    Handling of fake typeglobs (scalars that are really globs
    in disguise) is seriously busted since 5.002 (it wasn't
    so in 5.001n).
    The problem is that mg_get() on a glob calls gv_efullname()
    which might coerce its first arg to a string.

    Sub-critical patch to conceivably fix some %SIG problems. (Shared hash key
    weren't being properly detected by some of the sig magic, but as shared
    hash keys wouldn't normally be used in %SIG it's unlikely this is a
    significant problem.)

    This patch changes neither behavior nor performance.  However, it does
    reduce code size and improve maintainability by combining some common
    code in gv_fullname() and gv_efullname().

Index: myconfig

    Update perlio-related variables.

Index: op.c

    This patch changes neither behavior nor performance.  However, it does

Index: opcode.pl

    Subject: Re: truncate with file name does not work (with patch)

    The prototype for truncate was changed so that perl won't die
    with C<use strict;> when the first arg is a bareword (filehandle).
    I think it was Tom (as in "tchrist") who brought this up.

    Here's a patch that undoes the damage, makes it work with
    C<use strict;>, and adds to the testsuite.

Index: perlio.c

    Removes an incorrect prototype for setlinebuf from
    perlio.c because it conflicts with the correct declaration in
    MachTen's stdio.h (and possibly other stdio's as well).

    Secondly, the code in perlio.c is not handling the (!PERLIO_IS_STDIO &
    HAS_F[GS]ETPOS) case.  The patch fixes this omission (in a rather lumpen
    manner).  I don't think this should affect platforms which try to hack a
    different path through the #ifdef forest, but this assertion would benefit
    from testing...

    Subject: Track SVs for destruction when -DPURIFY

    When checking for memory leaks, I compiled Perl with "-DPURIFY".
    Although that flag improves the leak checking, it also breaks
    destruction of global objects, because SVs aren't kept in captive
    arenas any more.

    This patch rectifies the problem by providing an alternative
    method for keeping track of SVs when Perl is compiled for Purify.
    It has no effect on normal operation.

Version 5.003_03
----------------

Most of the changes in 5.003_03 are to make the build and installation
process more robust.  The details are described below.  A very brief
summary is:

o Visible Changes to Core Functionality

   -Support for tied filehandles.

o Configure enhancements

   -How to build and install a shared libperl.so is now documented
    and supported, though it's not the default for most platforms.

o Bug fixes

   -Support bit operations on strings longer than 15 bytes.

   -If a regex supplied to split() contains paranthesized subpatterns
    that can result in null matches, perl no longer coredumps.

   -Fix problems with each() on tied hashes.

   -Make h2ph architecture-independent by using Config at run-time
    rather than extraction time.

o Specific Changes

Here are the specific file-by-file changes.

This is patch perl5.003_03.pat to perl version 5.003_02.
This takes you from 5.003_02 to 5.003_03.

To apply this patch, run the above commands,
cd to your perl source directory and then type

	patch -p1 -N < perl5.003_03.pat

The changes are described after each /^Index/ line below.  This is
designed so you can examine each change with a command such as

	csplit -k perl5.003_03.pat '/^Index:/' '{99}'

Index: Changes

	Include 5.003_03 change notes.

	Move older change notes to separate files.

Index: Changes5.000

	New file.  Changes from perl4.036 to 5.000.

Index: Changes5.001

	New file.  Changes from 5.000 to 5.001

Index: Changes5.002

	New file.  Changes from 5.001 to 5.002

Index: Changes5.003

	New file.  Changes from 5.002 to 5.003

Index: Configure

	Relaxed warning about ksh on exotic machines.

	Changed usesafe to useopcode.

	Add search for gzip and zip.

	Look more carefully for $sh (the Bourne-ish shell).
	Use that info to set $startsh correctly.

	Change prompts for PerlIO interface.  See INSTALL
	for how this is supposed to work.  The default is
	still the same as in 5.003_02, namely don't use
	any fancy new PerlIO stuff.

	Don't look for sigvec() since we don't actually use it.
	(Plus, it used to print an alarming misleading message about
	race conditions.)

	Look for stdio's _filbuf under the possible names of
	_filbuf, __filbuf, and _fill.

	New $useshrplib variable to control whether we build a shared
	libperl.so.  The name of the library is in $libperl.
	Always install it in $installarchlib/CORE/$libperl.

	Check for <sys/resource.h> and <sys/wait.h> for NetBSD.

	Replace old $altmake stuff with newer autoconf-ish
	$make_set_make, which checks if $make sets $(MAKE).  Now you
	choose an alternate make with sh Configure -Dmake=gmake (or
	whatever).

	Remove 'ln' for the list of essential commands.  Simulate
	it with 'cp' if necessary.

	Change `logname` prompts to handle extra gratuitous spaces in
	Ultrix output.

	Autodetect os2.

	Fix silly bug in checking for fully-qualified names in /etc/hosts.

	Generalize Gconvert tests.  Give correct and more useful
	error messages.

	Use $obj_ext instead of literal '.o' in the dynaloader test.

	Include appropriate header files in bcopy() and memcpy()
	tests.  Note whether memmove is available.

	Check whether struct sigaction works (needed for Solaris 2.5
	with -Xc).

	Include appropriate header files for randbits test.

Index: INSTALL

	Add note about space requirements.

	Update to match Configure changes (Opcode vs. Safe,
	useperlio, useshrplib, etc.)

	Reorganize the structure of some of the hints.

	Miscellaneous clarifications.

Index: MANIFEST

	Updated.  5.003_02 introduced some massive patches, mostly
	due to spacing changes.  I didn't bother to sort them all out;
	I just started with 5.003's MANIEFST.

Index: Makefile.SH

	Support the new simplified shared libperl mechanism.

	Use new $make_set_make directive.

	Remove redundant libperl Make variable.

	Remove unnecessary MAB variable.

	Remove dependency of minitest on lib/Config.pm, since it could
	well have been a failure of configpm that inspired testing
	miniperl in the first place!

Index: Porting/Glossary

	New file describing all the config.sh variables.
	Eventually, I hope to fill this directory with other useful
	stuff.

Index: README.os2

	Replace old README.os2 with more up-to-date os2/README.

Index: config_H

	Updated to match current Configure and config_h.SH.
	Some rearrangement of parts has occurred due to new
	dependencies in the metaconfig units.

Index: config_h.SH

	Updated to match current Configure and config_h.SH.
	Some rearrangement of parts has occurred due to new
	dependencies in the metaconfig units.

	Include full descriptions of ARCHLIB, OLDARCHLIB, PRIVLIB,
	SITEARCH, and SITELIB.  Previous versions just included the
	~-expanded names (with unhelpful descriptions).  No functionality
	is changed, but maybe it's a little better documented now.

Index: doio.c

	Possibly Include <signal.h> and <unistd.h>

Index: doop.c

	No longer prefer bcmp over memcmp when order doesn't matter.

	Support bit operations on strings longer than 15 bytes.

Index: embed.h

	Auto-generated.

Index: embed.pl

	Expand warning at the top.

Index: ext/IO/IO.pm

	Clean up docmentation installation errors.

Index: ext/IO/lib/IO/Seekable.pm

	Clean up docmentation installation errors.

Index: ext/IO/lib/IO/Select.pm

	Clean up docmentation installation errors.

Index: ext/Opcode/Opcode.xs

	Add support for tied filehandles.

Index: ext/SDBM_File/sdbm/sdbm.h

	Change the Mymalloc to match Perl_malloc in perl.h.

Index: ext/util/make_ext

	Typo change.
	Get rid of unused altmake.

Index: global.sym

	Fix problems with each() on tied hashes.

Index: handy.h

	Change safe*alloc functions to have prototypes that
	match the system's malloc and free types.  That is, use
	Malloc_t instead of char *, and Free_t instead of void.
	This is necessary so . . .

	Safefree cast matches type of free() whether it's perl's
	malloc/free or the system's malloc/free.

Index: hints/README.hints

	Remove out-of-date info.

	Document a bit about how hint files work.

Index: hints/aix.sh

	qmaxmem hint doesn't apply to gcc.

Index: hints/dgux.sh

	Configure will now automatically detect shared libperl stuff.

Index: hints/dynixptx.sh

	Fix typo in comment.

	Configure will now automatically detect shared libperl stuff.

Index: hints/epix.sh

	Use glibpth instead of libpth.  This allows Configure to
	add local directories, such as /opt/local/lib, etc.

Index: hints/irix_6_2.sh

	Include some info on cc -n32 compile.

Index: hints/linux.sh

	Configure now tests gcvt() more thoroughly.

Index: hints/machten_2.sh

	Update where to find dld.

Index: hints/mips.sh

	Use glibpth instead of libpth.

Index: hints/next_3.sh

	Build up $mab dynamically.  Since $mab isn't used anywhere
	anymore, this is useless.  However, $mab was never used for
	next_3.sh anyway, so there's been no change in functionality.

Index: hints/next_4.sh

	Get rid of extraneous isnext_4 variable.  Configure and
	Makefile.SH will use $osname and $osvers instead.

	Build up $mab dynamically based on available architectures.

	Absorb $mab into ccflags and ccdlflags.  I hope that will
	cover everything.  (Configure should automatically remove
	the -arch stuff from cppflags.)

	Configure now knows next4 needs to use a shared libperl.5.so.

	Allow users to use -Dprefix.

Index: hints/os2.sh

	Try to update to reflect newer shared libperl stuff.
	I probably goofed :-).

Index: hints/sco.sh

	Additional notes on using icc.

	Additional flags for dynamic loading.

Index: hints/solaris_2.sh

	Perl.h no longer prefers bcmp, so it's again ok if Configure
	finds them, since perl will prefer the mem* versions anyway.

Index: hints/sunos_4_0.sh

	Don't include <unistd.h>

Index: hints/sunos_4_1.sh

	Add brief note about GNU as and ld.

	Don't include <unistd.h>

	Add notes about WHOA THERE messages.

Index: hints/titanos.sh

	Include sfio in libswanted.

	Don't set libpth any more.

Index: hints/umips.sh

	New hint file.

Index: hv.c

	Use memcmp even in cases where ordering doesn't matter.

	Fix problems with each() on tied hashes.

Index: installperl

	Simplify installation of shared libperl.so.

	Avoid reaching Command Failed!!! with /usr/bin/perl.

Index: lib/AutoSplit.pm

	Clean up docmentation installation errors.

Index: lib/ExtUtils/MM_Unix.pm

	Remove MAB references.

	Use 'useshrplib' instead of 'd_shrplib'

Index: lib/ExtUtils/MakeMaker.pm

	Remove mab references.

Index: lib/FindBin.pm

	Clean up docmentation installation errors.

Index: lib/Symbol.pm

	Put back in the BEGIN { require 5.002; }.  The version in
	5.003_02 wouldn't work in 5.002 anyway.  Further, the whole
	point of the construct is to catch 5.001m, so we can't use
	syntax introduced after 5.001m to do that.

Index: lib/Text/Wrap.pm

	Remove double 'use strict'.

Index: lib/perl5db.pl

	Add explicit '&' to avoid warnings under strict refs.

Index: lib/sigtrap.pm

	Clean up docmentation installation errors.

Index: makedepend.SH

	Use Configure's $sh and $make_set_make variables.

Index: mg.c

	Include <unistd.h>

	Use Safefree() macro instead of safefree() function with
	a (possibly) incorrect cast.  The whole point of the
	Safefree() macro is that it does the correct cast for you.


Index: patchlevel.h

	Change to SUBVERSION 3.

Index: perl.c

	Include <unistd.h>

Index: perl.h

	No longer prefer bcmp slightly for comparisons that don't care
	about ordering.

	Rely on Configure setting SH_PATH.

	Change the function name to Pause() instead of pause() to
	avoid potential prototype problems.  (This naming convention
	is similar to the Fwrite and Fflush macros.)

	Fix problems with each() on tied hashes.

	Work around crypt prototype problem on NeXT.

Index: perlio.c

	Fixes to support non-std stdio.

Index: perlio.h

	Try to document the various #defines a bit.  This is far from
	finished.

	Remove a lot of trailing whitespace.  (It's of no consequence, but
	but I'm not going to redo the patch just to put back in the trailing
	whitespace either.)

Index: perlsdio.h

	Fixes to support non-std stdio.

Index: perly.c

	Restore use of Safefree() macro.

Index: perly.c.diff

	Restore use of Safefree() macro.

Index: perly.h

	Delete duplicate line.

Index: plan9/buildinfo

	Update.

	Clean up docmentation installation errors.

Index: pod/perlxstut.pod

	Clean up docmentation installation errors.

Index: pod/pod2man.PL

	Clean up docmentation installation errors.

Index: pp.c

	Add support for tied filehandles.

	If a regex supplied to split() contains paranthesized subpatterns
	that can result in null matches, perl coredumps.

Index: pp_hot.c

	Use memcmp instead of bcmp even when we don't care about order.

	Add support for tied filehandles.

Index: pp_sys.c

	Include <unistd.h>, <sys/wait.h>, and <sys/resource.h>.
	(The latter two are especially for NetBSD.)

	Don't assume sys/time.h and sys/select.h can't coexist.

	Use Pause macro.

Index: proto.h

	Fix safe*alloc and safefree prototypes.

Index: regexec.c

	Use memcmp instead of bcmp even when we don't care about order.

	Use memcmp instead of bcmp even when we don't care about order.

Index: t/lib/opcode.t

	Add support for tied filehandles.

Index: t/op/bop.t

	Support bit operations on strings longer than 15 bytes.

Index: t/op/misc.t

	Add support for tied filehandles.

Index: t/op/split.t

	If a regex supplied to split() contains paranthesized subpatterns
	that can result in null matches, perl coredumps.

Index: toke.c

	Include <unistd.h>.

Index: utils/h2ph.PL

	Make h2ph architecture-independent by using Config at run-time
	rather than extraction time.

Index: writemain.SH

	Remove unnecessary curlies.  (They are a leftover from
	an older auto_init mechanism.)

Index: x2p/Makefile.SH

	Use Configure's $sh and $make_set_make.

	Remove MAB stuff, since it's now in ccflags.

	Keep 5.003's RCS info.

Index: x2p/a2p.h

	Keep 5.003's RCS info.

Index: x2p/str.c

	Use Configure's FILE_filbuf macro instead of a raw _filbuf.


----------------
Version 5.003_02
----------------

o Visible Changes to Core Functionality
  - Redefining constant subs, or changing sub's prototype now give warnings.
  - Fixes for ++/-- of values close to max/min size of an integer
  - Warning for un-qualified bareword as handler in $SIG{}.
  - UNIVERSAL::isa can now be called as static method.

o Changes in Core Internals
  - PerlIO abstraction added.
    Perl core and standard extensions no longer assume ANSI C's stdio is IO
    mechanism, Default Configure mode is still to use stdio via set of C macros.
    Alternate modes are to use stdio via one perlio.c module, or
    to use sfio if available.

  - Several bug fixs from perl5-porters
      - Make sources non-ANSI C correct again.
      - SUPER in gv.c
      - Last of shared-hash-key patches
      - eval '(0,1..3)'; # --> SegFault
      - coredumps after simple subsitutes.
      - Correction to UNIVERSAL::VERSION docs.
      - Fixed io_udp test.
      - Fixed another abuse of malloc'ed memory.
  - Enabled DEBUGING_MSTATS whenever perl's malloc() is used.
  - Reverted to default of not hiding perl's malloc (if used).

o Changes in the Standard Library and Utilities
  - Fixed MakeMaker for static SDBM and builing in a link tree.
  - Upgraded to IO-1.09, and includes latest (still experimental) IO::Select.
  - Documentation/test tweak to DB_File
  - h2xs upgrade to allow use C::Scan module

o Changes in OS-specific and Build-time Support
  - Attempted to re-created 5.003_01's NeXT support with metaconfig units.
  - Updated MANIFEST
  - make minitest now depends on lib/Config.pm, as some of tests require it.
  - Included latest plan9 sub-directory
  - Applied OS/2 patches.
  - Typo patch for VMS.


----------------
Version 5.003_01
----------------

Version 5.003_01 contains bugfixes and additions accumulated since
version 5.002_01, since the patch to version 5.003 was deliberately
kept simple.  In addition to numerous small bugfixes in the core,
library files, and documentation, this patch contains several
significant revisions, summarized below:

o Visible Changes to Core Functionality

  - A port to Plan9 has been started, and changes are integrated into
    the standard distribution.  As of this release, the Perl core
    and several common extensions are working.

  - A set of basic methods in the UNIVERSAL class have been added to
    the Perl core.  Since UNIVERSAL is an implicit member of every
    class's @ISA, the methods can be called via any object.

  - A mandatory warning has been added for 'declarations' of lexical
    variables using the "my" operator which mask an existing lexical
    variable declared in the same scope, making the previous variable
    inaccessible by its name.

  - The "use" and "require" operators have been extended to allow
    checking of the required module's version.  The "use" operator
    can now be used for an immediate version check of Perl itself.

  - A new "strict" pragma, "strict untie", has been added, which
    produces an error if a tied value is untied when other references
    exist to the internal object implementing the tie.

  - Barewords used as associative array keys (i.e. when specifying
    an associative array element like $foo{__BAR} or on the left
    side of the => operator) may now begin with an underscore as
    well as an alphabetic character.

  - Some of the configuration information previously produced by the
    -v switch has been moved to the -V switch, in order to keep -v
    output concise.

o Changes in Core Internals

  - Symbol table and method lookups have been made faster.

  - Perl subroutines which just return a constant value are now
    optimized at compile time into inline constants.

  - Management of keys for associative arrays has been improved to
    conserve space when the same keys are reused frequently, and
    to pass true Perl values to tie functions, instead of stringified
    representations.

  - Messages normally output to stderr may be directed to another
    stream when Perl is built.  This allows some platforms to
    present diagnostic output in a separate window from normal
    program results.

  - A bug which caused suiperl to fail silently, albeit securely,
    in version 5.003 on some systems has been fixed.

  - Management of Unix-style signal handlers via the %SIG associative
    array has been made safer.

  - Several global C symbols have been renamed to eliminate collisions
    with system C header files or libraries on some platforms.
    Unfortunately, this means that dynamic extensions compiled under
    previous versions of Perl will need to be rebuilt for Perl
    5.003_01.  We're in the process of cleaning up Perl's C
    namespace to make it easier to link Perl with other binaries,
    so this will probably happen again between now and version 5.004.
    After that, we'll do our best to maintain binary compatibility
    between versions.

  - An alternate allocation strategy has been added to Perl's
    optional private memory management routines.  This strategy,
    which may be selected when Perl is built, is designed to
    conserve memory in programs which allocate many small
    chunks of memory with sizes near a power of 2, as is often
    the case in Perl programs.

  - Several memory leaks in the creation and destruction of
    multiple interpreters have been fixed.

o Changes in the Standard Library and Utilities

  - The Opcode extension, which allows you to control a program's
    access to Perl operations, has been added to the standard
    distribution.  This extends the work begun in the original
    Safe extension, and subsumes it.  The Safe interface is still
    available.

  - The IO extension, which provides a set of classes for object-
    oriented handling of common I/O tasks, has been added to the
    standard distribution.  The IO classes will form the basis
    for future development of Perl's I/O interface, and will
    subsume the FileHandle class in the near future.  The default
    class to which all Perl I/O handles belong is now IO::Handle,
    rather than FileHandle.

  - The ExtUtils::Embed library module, which provides a set
    of utility function to help in embedding Perl in other
    applications, has been added to the standard distribution.

  - The Fatal library module, which provides a simple interface
    for creating "do-or-die" equivalents of existing functions,
    has been added to the standard distribution.

  - The FindBin library module, which determines the full path
    to the currently executing program, has been added to the
    standard distribution.

  - The DB_File extension, and the Getopt::Long, Test::Harness,
    Text::Tabs, Text::Wrap, Time::Local and sigtrap library modules
    have been updated to the authors' latest versions.

  - The Carp library module now considers the @ISA chain when
    determining the caller's package for inclusion in error messages.

  - The h2xs, perlbug, and xsubpp utilities have been updated.

  - The standard Perl debugger has been updated, and the information
    provided to the debugger when an XSUB is called has been improved,
    making it possible for alternate debuggers (such as Devel::DProf)
    to do a better job of tracking XSUB calls.

  - The pod documentation formatting tools in the standard distribution
    can now handle characters in the input stream whose high bit is set.

  - The cperl-mode EMACS editing mode has been updated.

o Changes in Documentation

  - Typographic and formatting errors have been corrected in the pod
    documentation for the core and standard library files

  - Explanations of several core operators have been improved

  - The perldebug, perlembed, perlipc, perlsec, and perltrap documents
    extensively revised.

o Changes in OS-specific and Build-time Support

  - Support for the NeXT platform has been extended through
    NeXTSTEP/OPENSTEP 4.0, and now includes the ability to create MABs.

  - Support for OS/2 has been extended as well, and now includes
    options for building a.out binaries.

  - Support for VMS has also been extended, incorporating improved
    processing of file specification strings, optional suppression of
    carriage control interpretation for record-structured files,
    improved support for the -S command line switch, a number of
    VMS-specific bugfixes, and significantly improved performance
    in line-oriented reading of files.

  - Several hints files have been added or updated: aux.sh (updated),
    convexos.sh (updated), irix_4.sh (updated), irix_5.sh (updated),
    irix_6_2.sh (updated), next_3.sh (updated), next_3_2.sh (new),
    next_3_3.sh (new), next_4.sh (new), os2/sh (updated),
    sco.sh (updated), and solaris_2.sh (updated).

  - The test driver for the regression tests now reports when a set
    of tests have been skipped (presumable because the operation
    they're designed to test isn't supported on the current system).
