=head2 Where to get this document

This document is posted regularly to comp.lang.perl.announce and
several other related newsgroups.  It is available in a variety of
formats from CPAN in the /CPAN/doc/FAQs/FAQ/ directory, or on the web
at http://www.perl.com/perl/faq/ .

=head2 How to contribute to this document

You may mail corrections, additions, and suggestions to
perlfaq-suggestions@perl.com .  This alias should not be 
used to I<ask> FAQs.  It's for fixing the current FAQ.

=head2 What will happen if you mail your Perl programming problems to the authors

Your questions will probably go unread, unless they're suggestions of
new questions to add to the FAQ, in which case they should have gone
to the perlfaq-suggestions@perl.com instead.

You should have read section 2 of this faq.  There you would have
learned that comp.lang.perl.misc is the appropriate place to go for
free advice.  If your question is really important and you require a
prompt and correct answer, you should hire a consultant.

=head1 Credits

When I first began the Perl FAQ in the late 80s, I never realized it
would have grown to over a hundred pages, nor that Perl would ever become
so popular and widespread.  This document could not have been written
without the tremendous help provided by Larry Wall and the rest of the
Perl Porters.
