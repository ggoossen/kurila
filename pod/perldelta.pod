perldelta - what will be new for perl v5.8.0

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This document does not exist yet.  When the Perl 5.8.0 is released
this document will describe the changes since Perl 5.6.0, the previous
major release.  In the meanwhile, see L<perl570delta> and
L<perl571delta>.

=head1 Reporting Bugs

If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles
recently posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl
bug database at http://bugs.perl.org.  There may also be
information at http://www.perl.com/perl/, the Perl Home Page.

If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the B<perlbug>
program included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down
to a tiny but sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the
output of C<perl -V>, will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be
analysed by the Perl porting team.
