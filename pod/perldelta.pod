=head1 NAME

perldelta - what's new for perl5.006 (as of 5.005_54)

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This document describes differences between the 5.005 release and this one.

=head1 Incompatible Changes

=head2 Perl Source Incompatibilities

None known at this time.

=head2 C Source Incompatibilities

=over 4

=item C<PERL_POLLUTE>

Release 5.005 grandfathered old global symbol names by providing preprocessor
macros for extension source compatibility.  As of release 5.006, these
preprocessor definitions are not available by default.  You need to explicitly
compile perl with C<-DPERL_POLLUTE> in order to get these definitions.

=item C<PL_na> and C<dTHR> Issues

The C<PL_na> global is now thread local, so a C<dTHR> declaration is needed
in the scope in which it appears.  XSUBs should handle this automatically,
but if you have used C<PL_na> in support functions, you either need to
change the C<PL_na> to a local variable (which is recommended), or put in
a C<dTHR>.

=head2 Binary Incompatibilities

This release is not binary compatible with the 5.005 release and its
maintenance versions.

=head1 BUGS

If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the headers of
recently posted articles in the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup.
There may also be information at http://www.perl.com/perl/, the Perl
Home Page.

If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the B<perlbug>
program included with your release.  Make sure you trim your bug down
to a tiny but sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the
output of C<perl -V>, will be sent off to <F<perlbug@perl.com>> to be
analysed by the Perl porting team.
