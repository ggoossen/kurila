=head1 NAME

perldelta - what is new for perl v5.9.0

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This document describes differences between the 5.8.0 release and
the 5.9.0 release.

=head1 Incompatible Changes

=head1 Core Enhancements

=head2 Tied Arrays with Negative Array Indices

Formerly, the indices passed to C<FETCH>, C<STORE>, C<EXISTS>, and
C<DELETE> methods in tied array class were always non-negative.  If
the actual argument was negative, Perl would call FETCHSIZE implicitly
and add the result to the index before passing the result to the tied
array method.  This behavior is now optional.  If the tied array class
contains a package variable named C<$NEGATIVE_INDICES> which is set to
a true value, negative values will be passed to C<FETCH>, C<STORE>,
C<EXISTS>, and C<DELETE> unchanged.
