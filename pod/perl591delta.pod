=head1 NAME

perldelta - what is new for perl v5.9.1

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This document describes differences between the 5.9.0 release and
the 5.9.1 release.

=head1 Incompatible Changes

=head1 Core Enhancements

=head2 Tied hashes in scalar context

As of perl 5.8.2, tied hashes did not return anything useful in scalar
context, for example when used as boolean tests:

	if (%tied_hash) { ... }

The old nonsensical behaviour was always to return false,
regardless of whether the hash is empty or has elements.

There is now an interface for the implementors of tied hashes to implement
the behaviour of a hash in scalar context, via the SCALAR method (see
L<perltie>).  Without a SCALAR method, perl will try to guess whether
the hash is empty, by testing if it's inside an iteration (in this case
it can't be empty) or by calling FIRSTKEY.

=head1 Modules and Pragmata

=head1 Utility Changes

C<find2perl> now assumes C<-print> as a default action. Previously, it
needed to be specified explicitly.

=head1 Reporting Bugs

If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles
recently posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl
bug database at http://bugs.perl.org/ .  There may also be
information at http://www.perl.com/ , the Perl Home Page.

If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the B<perlbug>
program included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down
to a tiny but sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the
output of C<perl -V>, will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be
analysed by the Perl porting team.
